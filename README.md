# Surface_Affinities_Optimization
Genetic algorithm optimization of surface affinities of small, neutral solutes through chemical group re-patterning

This repository contains code associated with the publication:

Monroe, J. I.; Jiao, S.; Davis, J.; Robinson Brown, D.; Katz, L.; Shell, M. S. Affinity of small-molecule solutes to hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and chemically patterned interfaces in aqueous solution. PNAS. In press.

If you use the code in this repository, culminating in a publication, please cite the above paper.

Note that the Jupyter Notebook for generating figures is only for documentation -- it will not run without data generated in the proper directory structure and with the proper names. While the code provided is capable of achieving this, data is also available upon request. It is not directly provided here as it requires more storage capacity than is appropriate for this repository alone.

Questions or other communication may be directed to shell@engineering.ucsb.edu or jacob.ian.monroe@gmail.com.
